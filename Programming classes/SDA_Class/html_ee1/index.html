     <p>A 16-year-old set sail from Portsmouth harbour on Saturday in a bid to 
        <br>become the youngest person to sail solo around the world.
    </p>
        <p>Michael Perham, who became the youngest person to cross the Atlantic <br>alone when he was 14, 
        left Portsmouth at 11:10 am aboard a 50-foot (15- <br>metre) yacht, his spokesman 
        Kizzi Nkwoch told AFP.
    </p>
    <p>He will cover 21,600 nautical miles, crossing every single line of longitude<br> and 
        the equator, in four and a half months, and his only <br>
        contact with family members back home will be limited to brief satellite conversations.</p>
   
   <p>Perham is expected back in Portsmouth in March 2009, around his 17th <br>birthday.</p>
   <p>"I'm a little bit nervous but otherwise really, really excited," Perham said <br>
     before setting sail, admitting that the voyage was "a little crazy".
